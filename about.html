    As a developer, I create applications that are clean, modular, and thoroughly tested in order to solve real problems for
    users. The ability to create anything that comes to mind is fascinating to me. Simply put, I like to make things and
    make them well. My past experience combined with my software engineering skills gives me a unique perspective in the
    workplace. Outside of work, I love rock climbing, mountain biking, road biking, camping, drinking coffee, brewing beer,
    and traveling.
